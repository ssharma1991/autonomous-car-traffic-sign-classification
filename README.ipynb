    "In this project, the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) has been used to train a convolutional neural network. Each image is represented as a 32x32 pixel RGB image. The number of sign images is then split into Training, Validation and Testing sets as follows.\n",

    "First, the motivation is to increase the amount of data to enhance the learning. Some of the traffic signs have an axis of symmetry i.e. they are invariant to fliping them vertically, horizontally or diagonally. An example is the \"Yield\" sign which as a vertical axis of symmetry passing through its center. Including this flipped data will help the model capture this inherent symmetry in some of the traffic signs. Also, some pairs of signs interchange between each other on flipping like \"Turn Right\" becomes \"Turn Left\". The Symmetric properties of signs are given in the table below\n",
